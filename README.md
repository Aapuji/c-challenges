# C Challenges
## Vector
A vector implementation in C. It's a resizable array.

## Linked List
Similar to a vector, but the each element (node) points to the next element in the sequence.

## Dictionary
I tried making a dictionary, similar to the one in python. It's key-value pairs.

## Hashtable
I tried creating a simple hash table, which is similar to a dictionary, but instead of keys and values, it has buckets, and in each one is a linked list of each key-value pair. To find out which bucket the pair goes into, it is fed into a hash function.
